# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a modern, premium Pegasus Gifting homepage as a guided, chat-style flow that helps users identify corporate gifting needs step-by-step and convert via WhatsApp or catalogue download.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a conversational, step-by-step chat UI landing flow with guided quick-reply choices, clear progression, and the ability to restart and revise earlier answers.
- Apply a consistent premium gold-and-white visual system (typography, spacing, shadows, components) across all UI states and ensure responsive mobile/desktop layout.
- Add interactive, accessible category exploration via premium category cards (with icons/visuals) that drive the next step in the flow (subcategory prompt/preview).
- Add conversion-focused CTAs surfaced at relevant points: configurable WhatsApp link and catalogue download from static assets/URL, including a bulk vs single-order intent branch.
- Incorporate subtle, purposeful micro-interactions/animations (e.g., message reveal, card entrance) to reinforce a “guided concierge” feel.
- Add and render static generated images from `frontend/public/assets/generated/` for hero/brand area and category visuals (no backend image handling).

**User-visible outcome:** Users experience a guided chat-style homepage that helps them choose gifting categories and intent (bulk vs single), then quickly contact via WhatsApp or download the catalogue, all within a premium gold-and-white branded UI.
