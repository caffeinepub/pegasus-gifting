## Summary
**Goal:** Update Pegasus Gifting to a premium, red-accented B2B guided chat experience that qualifies leads in 2–3 steps and hands off to WhatsApp naturally.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the visual theme to a light background with consistent bold red primary accents (CTAs, focus rings, borders, and chat highlights), removing any blue/purple-dominant primary accents.
- Add a premium B2B header featuring the brand name “PEGASUS GIFTING” alongside a red Pegasus logo, responsive on mobile and desktop.
- Reshape the homepage into a guided, chat-led flow (quick-reply buttons/cards) rather than a long static page.
- Implement minimal branching: intent selection (Bulk vs Single/few vs Unsure/Exploration) → second question (quantity range or purpose/occasion) → WhatsApp handoff only after the second answer.
- Add an Unsure/Exploration path with a short “How It Works” explanation in-chat, plus a view/download option for the Master Catalogue PDF before suggesting WhatsApp.
- Highlight curated gift categories as selectable cards within the flow (and/or as an optional exploration step) while removing/avoiding any pricing, delivery promises/timelines, or vendor/supplier details from UI copy.
- Update WhatsApp handoff UX/copy to “Speak to our team” and prefill the WhatsApp message with the user’s selections (intent + quantity/purpose + category if chosen).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors land on a premium red-themed Pegasus Gifting site that guides them through a short conversational qualification flow and then (optionally) continues to WhatsApp with a prefilled summary of their choices, with catalogue access available for exploration.
