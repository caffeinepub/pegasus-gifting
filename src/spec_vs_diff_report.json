      "requirement": "A clearly visible navigation/menu area includes a \"Home\" option labeled exactly \"Home\".",
      "reason": "The implementation hides the text label \"Home\" on small screens (`hidden sm:inline`), leaving only an icon visible; this may not satisfy the requirement that the option be labeled exactly \"Home\" in a clearly visible way across viewports.",
